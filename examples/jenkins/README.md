# Jenkins Example

This example will guide you through an example Jenkinsfile that will build, deploy and release your bot code.
You will need to adapt this file to fit your needs as this is simply an example of the steps mentioned above.

Define the necessary secrets (`botcity-server`, `botcity-login` and `botcity-key`) using the [Credentials plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/) an access them through environment variables.

## More information

You can find more information about Jenkinsfile in the [official documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/).
