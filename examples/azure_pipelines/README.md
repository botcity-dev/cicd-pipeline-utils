# Azure Pipelines Example

This example will guide you through a sample Azure Pipelines YAML file that will build, deploy, and release your bot code.
You will need to adapt this file to fit your needs as this is simply an example of the steps mentioned above.

Define the necessary secrets (`SERVER`, `LOGIN`, and `KEY`) in the pipeline settings under **Pipeline Settings > Variables > Secret Variables**.
