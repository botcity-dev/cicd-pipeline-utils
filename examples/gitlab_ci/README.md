# GitLab CI Example

This example will guide you through a sample GitLab CI YAML file that will build, deploy, and release your bot code.
You will need to adapt this file to fit your needs as this is simply an example of the steps mentioned above.

Define the necessary secrets (`SERVER`, `LOGIN`, and `KEY`) in **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.
